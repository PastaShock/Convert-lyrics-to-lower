# Make Lower Case
this is a project that was started by Stas and completed by me as part of a group effort to create a simple python script that takes a plain-text input file and converts it to sentence case with capitalised pronouns/possesives in reference to God.

### Usage:
`python3 MakeLowerCase.py [your-input-file.txt]`

### Future Work:
Converting this script to js to use on a NodeJS project:
- create NodeJS project base (express, pug)
    - ingest file via UI
    - create a downloadable file and or show results in UI
    - host locally
